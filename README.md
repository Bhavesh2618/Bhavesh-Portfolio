- **Integrate a Blog Section:** To showcase knowledge and keep visitors engaged, integrating a blog section where tech articles can be written would be beneficial. This section could include posts about web development trends, UI/UX design tips, and other relevant topics. The blog posts can be displayed in a clean, organized manner with easy navigation.

  - Alt text for images to help screen readers describe them accurately.

  - Sufficient color contrast to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.
